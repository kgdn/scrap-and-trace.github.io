This fork of the website reflects the state of the website prior to the changes made during the third stage of the group project (which I had no involvement in), thus I decided to make an archive of the website with only my commits and changes. The current website can still be viewed at https://scrap-and-trace.github.io, however you will need to run Jekyll locally to see how the website looked prior to stage 3.
